@copilot The job failed due to an npm dependency resolution conflict between jest (version 27.5.1) and ts-jest (which requires jest ^29.0.0 or ^30.0.0). To resolve this, update the jest version in your package.json from "^27.5.1" to "^29.0.0" or a compatible version supported by ts-jest.

Update the devDependencies section in your package.json as follows:

```
"devDependencies": {
  ...
  "jest": "^29.0.0",
  "ts-jest": "^29.4.0",
  ...
}
```

After updating, run npm install again. This will align the jest version with ts-jest's requirements and resolve the ERESOLVE error. You can view your current package.json here:
